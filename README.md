# # 💰 Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning 💎
📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting future gold prices using machine learning techniques. It analyzes historical gold price data and market indicators such as inflation rate, USD value, stock index, and interest rates to build a reliable predictive model. 📈

🎯 Objective

To create a data-driven system that accurately forecasts gold prices and helps investors make informed financial decisions.

⚙️ Key Features

📊 Data preprocessing and cleaning

🧠 Implementation of regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

🔍 Correlation analysis between gold price and other economic factors

📈 Visualization of trends and predictions using Matplotlib and Seaborn

📉 Model evaluation using R² score, MAE, and RMSE

🧩 Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy – Data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning modeling

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains:

Date

Gold Price (USD/Ounce)

Stock Index (S&P 500, etc.)

Crude Oil Prices

Exchange Rate (USD/INR)

Inflation Rate

You can download or collect data from sources like Kaggle or Yahoo Finance. 📑

🚀 Steps Involved

Load and clean the dataset

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature selection and scaling

Train ML models

Evaluate model performance

Predict future gold prices

📊 Result

The model provides accurate gold price predictions with visual trend insights, helping users understand market movement and make better investment choices. 💹✨

🧠 Future Enhancements

Integrate with live gold price APIs for real-time prediction

Build a web dashboard using Streamlit or Flask

Add deep learning models (LSTM) for time series forecasting
